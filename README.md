# Dungeon Rooms Mod
### What it does:
Detects the name of the room in a Hypixel Skyblock Dungeon for easier secret finding. When you enter a room inside of a 
dungeon, it will display the name of the room at the top of your screen and tell you if there's a fairy soul in the room.

### Why is this useful?
For those who haven't memorized secrets, scrolling through each channel of the Dungeon Secrets Guide
discord in order to find the correct channel takes forever. This mod saves you time by telling you the name of the room,
so you don't have to spend time trying to find the correct channel within the DSG discord. Eventually, I plan on adding
a popup link which takes you straight to the correct channel.
