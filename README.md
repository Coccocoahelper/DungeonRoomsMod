# Dungeon Rooms Mod
### What it does:
This mod gives a hotkey to directly launch either the Dungeon Secrets Guide(DSG) Discord channel or the Skyblock
Personalized (SBP) Dungeon Secrets Mod for the room you are currently in. This makes finding the secrets in a dungeon
room much faster than before. When you enter a room inside of a dungeon, it will also display the name of the room at
the top of your screen and tell you if there's a fairy soul in the room.

### Why is this useful?
For those who haven't memorized secrets, scrolling through each channel of the Dungeon Secrets Guide Discord in order to
find the correct channel takes forever. This mod saves you time letting you hit a single key which will open the correct
channel for you in Discord.
