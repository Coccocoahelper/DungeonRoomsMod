# Dungeon Rooms Mod
### What it does:
This mod gives a hotkey to directly launch either the Dungeon Secrets Guide(DSG) Discord channel or the Skyblock
Personalized (SBP) Dungeon Secrets Mod for the room you are currently in. This makes finding the secrets in a dungeon
room much faster than before. When you enter a room inside of a dungeon, it will also display the name of the room at
the top of your screen and tell you if there's a fairy soul in the room.

### Why is this useful?
For those who haven't memorized secrets, scrolling through each channel of the Dungeon Secrets Guide Discord in order to
find the correct channel takes forever. This mod saves you time letting you hit a single key which will open the correct
channel for you in Discord.

### Discord:
https://discord.gg/7B5RbsArYK

### Main Hotkey:
 - By default, the hotkey is set to "O"
 - You can change the hotkey in the normal Minecraft controls menu
 - The hotkey opens a GUI menu that allows you to select whether you want to open secret images in the Dungeon Secret
  Guide (DSG) Discord or in the Skyblock Personalized (SBP) Dungeon Secrets Mod (separate mod, made by a different dev)
 - You can make the hotkey directly open either DSG or SBP and bypass the menu by running: /room set \<gui | dsg | sbp\>
 
### Commands:
You probably won't need to use any of these:
 - /room - Tells you in chat what room you are standing in, in the chat.
 - /room help - Displays this message in chat.
 - /room open - Opens the gui for opening either DSG or SBP.
 - /room dsg - Directly opens DSG in the Discord client.
 - room sbp - Directly opens the SBP secrets (if you have the mod installed).
 - /room set \<gui | dsg | sbp\> - Configure whether the hotkey opens the selector GUI or directly goes to DSG/SBP      
 - /room move \<x\> \<y\> - Moves the GUI room name display to a coordinate. \<x\> and \<y\> are numbers between 0 and 100. Default is 50 for \<x\> and 5 for \<y\>
 - /room togglegui - Toggles whether room name is automatically displayed in GUI. Default is on
 - /room togglechat - Toggles whether room name is automatically displayed in Chat. Default is off
